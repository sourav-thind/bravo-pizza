      customer: "Michael Smith",
      review: "Best pizza in the world. The bacon is real sliced bacon cut into large pieces instead of that gross processed stuff you get everywhere else. Same with the hamburger, which is real fried ground beef instead of that gray balled stuff you get elsewhere. I live in NS and every time I come through, Bravo is a must. Mike makes the best",

      review: "This is a diamond in the rough. We lived in Riverview for over 2 years before discovering this place. Home made pizza style. My wife, kids and myself all confessed this is one of the pizza's we have ever had. I love the Donair's. Excellent price. Great service. Can be hard to get through on the phone. This is due to the quality. Everyone wants this treat for supper.",
